# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Share option control from the application header without changing any other header behavior or layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the ShareWebsiteDialog trigger/button from the header so no Share control appears there.
- Keep all other header elements and interactions unchanged (logo/home, navigation items, login/logout, mobile menu).

**User-visible outcome:** The header no longer shows any Share button/icon/menu entry, while the rest of the header works exactly as before.
