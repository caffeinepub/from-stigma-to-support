  "summary": "The diff shows changes to `Header.tsx`, but the provided snippet is truncated and does not conclusively demonstrate that the ShareWebsiteDialog trigger/control was removed from all header contexts (desktop and mobile). Additionally, `project_state.json` was modified, which is unrelated to the requested UI-only change.",

      "requirement": "Remove the Share option UI control rendered in the app header (the ShareWebsiteDialog trigger button) and keep the rest of the header layout/behavior unchanged.",
      "reason": "The `Header.tsx` diff is truncated before the full header (notably the mobile menu section). While the visible portion does not show a share trigger, the truncated portion could still render a Share button/menu entry, so the removal cannot be verified from the provided diff summary alone.",
